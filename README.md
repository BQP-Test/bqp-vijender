./start-services.sh
```


### Configuring Environment Variables
Environment variables need to be set up in the .env files located within each service's configuration directory. Hereâ€™s how you can modify these settings:

## Authentication Service
Navigate to the Authentication Service configuration directory:

```bash
cd auth_profile_service/auth_profile_service/src/config/
```
## Edit the .env file to include your Google OAuth credentials:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```
## Notification Service
Navigate to the Notification Service configuration directory:

```bash
cd notification_service/notification_service/src/config/
```

## Update the .env file with your email service credentials:

```bash
